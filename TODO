- list of items still to do

- [] basemap import or through opensource
- [] export dfs to excel sheets (work out whether these can be imported to templates)
- [] finish gui
- [] debug ax labels
- [] invasive species - upload sample data and update function to work on new variables
- [] labels for sites


gui thoughts
 - add plot statements into new function and call elements of function based on checkboxes when pressing run in the gui hopefully should only plot the required 
 features based on selection from gui dialogue.
