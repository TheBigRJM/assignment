# egm722 programming for GIS and remote sensing
script and data for assessment

## 1. What is the program for?
The purpose of this program is to automate spatial ecological data searches for use in environmental impact assessments. Data searches are systematic but the required input and output information can vary between each search. Generally data searches are conducted using an input feature consisting of either a polygon, point or line and a specified distance buffer which can be variable. The data required as part of the search also differs based on requirements for example looking for species OR nature connservation sites OR both, or possibly a subset of certain species.

This program allows the user to input either a grid reference or upload a shapefile from which to run the search, specify a buffer radius (in metres) and select the output data required for the search.
